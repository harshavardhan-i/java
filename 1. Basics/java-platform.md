### What is java
* Interpreted, threaded and dynamic language 
* Platform agnostic
* Java is a strongly typed language.

### Java Platform
* JDK includes JRE which in turn runs JVM
    - JDK: Java Development Kit
    - JRE: Java Runtime environment, API + JVM
    - JVM: Java Virtual Machine
* API: Bundled java libraries that come with JDK.
* Platform flow:
    1. Java source code converted to bytecode by java compiler.
    2. Bytecode runs on top of JVM.
    3. JVM converts bytecode to machine language.
* Bytecode - It's a computer object code processed by program; usually a virtual machine.
* Java platform supports different languages built for JVM (Groovy, Clojure, Scala...)

### Editions and Versions of Java
* Different combinations of OS and Hardware needs different JVM versions.
* There are three editions:
    * JME: Java micro edition - Used for IoTs and embedded systems
    * JSE: Java standard edition - Used for desktop applications
        * JFX: Java FX is used to build GUI, Bundled with JSE.
    * JEE: Java enterprise edition - Used for distributed systems, web etc.
* Java is backwards compatible.
