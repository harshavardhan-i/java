### Initialization blocks
* It's an explicit block of code that runs every time an new object is created.

* We can have multiple initialization blocks.

* Invocation order:
    * First inline initialization/initialization block is run/initialized, based on the placement within class.
    * Then the constructor is called.

* Helps write complex logic and runs for every object.
