### Memory management:
* JVM handles memory behind the scene, Objects reference and objects assignments are done using heaps and stacks.
* Stacks are a list of reference define within a block of code aka scope.
* Heap is a larger storage in memory, where objects are stored.
* Heap has it's own subsections.
