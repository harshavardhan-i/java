### What is java
* Interpreted, threaded and dynamic language 
* Platform agnostic

### Java Platform
* JVM: Java virtual machine - JDK includes JRE which in turn runs JVM.
* API: application programming interface - Bundled java libraries that come with JDK.
* APIs and JVM combined are called JRE.
* Platform flow:
    1. Java source code converted to bytecode by java compiler.
    2. Bytecode runs on top of JVM.
    3. JVM converts bytecode to machine language.
* Bytecode - It's a computer object code processed by program; usually a virtual machine.
* Java platform supports different languages built for JVM (Groovy, Clojure, Scala...)

### Editions and Versions of Java
