* String is a java object, it also behaves as primitives
* It's a sequence of indexed chars
* Don't necessarily need to create new object, a literal surrounded by double quotes will do
* A literal surrounded by single quote is a char literal
* When new keyword is used to create same string, two objects are created and pointed at 
* Where as when same string literal is assigned variables refere to the same object in the memory
* null and "" (empty string) are two different things
* String is immutable

* Primitive behavior:
    - (+) - works on strings
    - (=) - works on strings
    - (+=) - works on strings
