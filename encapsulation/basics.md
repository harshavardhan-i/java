### Encapsulation
* Technique of bundling data with methods that operate on that data, e.x. - object is encapsulation
* Hiding how inner operations are done

### Data hiding
* Data access is prohibited
* Data is hidden using access modifiers like private modifier.
* private - only accessible to the class itself, not even it's instance/object

### Setters, Getters
* Accessors/mutators are also know as getters/setters
* Java bean - Simple class with private fileds and some setters/getters, constructors etc. Few more rules.

### Access modifiers
* Access modifiers can be added to classes, methods, constructors, static/instance variables as well.
* Types of modifiers:
    - Public - Accessible everywhere
    - Private - Only accessible by declaring class
    - Proctected - Accessible by classes within same package or extending class
    - *Default - In the absence of no modifiers, this is applied. Accessible by declaring class.
