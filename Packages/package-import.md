### Packages
 * It is a code folder, it bundles groups of related types together.
 * By default we have access to two packages:
   - Current package
   - 'java.lang' - contains System, String etc.

### Imports
 * Imports does not increase the bytecode size
 * Import might increase compile time but that's it
 * "*" - only grabs classes not folders
