### Operators
* Order of precedence
* Bitshift operators:
    - (>>) signed shift operator: respects the sign and fills in with 1/0 based on if it's negative/positive respectively
    - (>>>) unsigned shift operator; fills in with 0s
* Bitwise operators:
    - (&) : and operator
    - (|) : or operator
    - (^) : xor operator
    - (~) : complement operator
* Logical operator: **Shortcircuits** i.e. if first statement evaluates then second is not evaluated,  Used for null pointer check.
    - && : and operator
    - || : or operator
* Post/pre increment/decrement operators:
    - x++: post increment, returns and then increments
    - ++x: pre increment, increments and then returns
* Ternary operator - (expression) ? trueOption : falseOption;

### Operator precedence
* Expressions evaluated from left to right
* */% > +-

### Enums
* Short for enumeration it is one of the labels.
