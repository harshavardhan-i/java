* **Polymorphism*** is the property that lets you substitute one type of object for the other.
* One object can be refered by several differnt types of references.
* Polymorphism: Greek origins -  ploy means many and morphism means forms
* An object type can be assigned to a reference type as long as the object type is a descendant of the refernce type.
* Here reference type is the class to the left and object type is the class to the right of new keyword.
* **Dynamic method dispatching** - JVM look for definition of the method in object first then tarverses up in inheritance tree.
* At compile time if a reference type object tries to access object type members it will fail.
