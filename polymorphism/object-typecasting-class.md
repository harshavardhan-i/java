* Object typecasting refers to typecasting more generic type to specific type
* Class caste exception occurs when parent object type is assigned to child object type while typecasting.
* To avoid this we use **instanceOf** keyword that allows to check if the object is instance of the typecasted class.

### The object class
* Every class extends Object class if we go up the hierarchy 
* Everything in Java is an object, except primitives
* Object calss has toString() and equals() methods
* So every object can use it.
