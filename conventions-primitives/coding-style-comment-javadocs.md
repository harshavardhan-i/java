### Coding style
 * Naming convention - Java is case sensitive
    - Java class names have upper camel-casing, meaning it starts with upper case/capital letter.
    - Lower camel-casing:
        * identifiers - names of a field a method, function, variable, package
        * they can have numbers, letters, underscore and dollar sign
        * Can't use reserved words as idententifiers

* **Comment** - 
    - Single line comment //
    - Block comment - Cannot have nested block comments. /* */
    - Java doc comment /** */
        * Used to create javadocs
        * comments written on top of the statement that needs to be defined
        * These comments gets converted to docs once run through javadoc tool
